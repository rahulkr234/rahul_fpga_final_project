Hi, Welcome to my final project for ECE 385

This is a top down shooter game with multiplayer functionality.

The game was built fully in hardware on system Verilog and the SV modules can be found at the zombieproject.srcs/source_1/new/

To run the game, you can use the xsa I have provided and import that into vitis. 
Then you will need to also import all the .c and .h files I have provided in the vitissoftware folder. 
This software is from lab 6.2 and is needed to support USB user input. But that should be everything you need.
